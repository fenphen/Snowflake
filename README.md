# Snowflake

A task is just an object that stores a certain sequel's statement and this will be then executed at a specific time

or in a certain interval that we can specify. It is important to note that in this task we can only specify one specific secured statement.

We can create standalone tasks with just one secure statement, or we can also create dependencies so

that one task will be executed after another task has been completed.   So in this lab, we'll learn and understand what is a task, will also learn how we can create a

task and the different scheduling methods.   How can we schedule this and use the different methods? How do we create standalone tasks? ..and how do we also create tasks with dependencies.

And then finally, we'll also learn how we can check the task history.

So let's not lose any more time and have a look on how we can create tasks and understand what they

are doing.
