Some queries take a long time to run.  The users get angry AND the costs can get fairly high for compute time.  A materialized 

view is one approach to minimize costs and frustration of users.  A regular view is just the text of a query saved to a named 

object but a materialized view actually stores data!  An MV is queried with a regular select statement.  When one of the base 

tables of the materialized view is updated, the MV is also updated.
