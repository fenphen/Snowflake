Streams are useful for ETL.  We use them to write data from our data sources into our Snowflake tables.  We might want to add 

what has changed in our source table into our target table.  Streams are objects that record (DML) changes made to a source

table.  Change Data Capture (CDC) is the process we are describing here.  We will be using INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements. 

which are called DML (data manipulation language).  

First, let us create a database and a table to practice our streams:

      CREATE OR REPLACE TRANSIENT DATABASE STREAMS_DB;

      -- Create example table 
      create or replace table sales_raw_staging(
        id varchar,
        product varchar,
        price varchar,
        amount varchar,
        store_id varchar);
        
 Note that the database will be deleted from our Snowflake instance when we logout (remember that keyword transient?)
